      "Each NFT Basilisk has a set of traits, mutations, and skills, minted immutably on-chain. The arena? A fully 3D metaverse battleground with wagers, livestreams, and faction wars. Players don’t just watch — they stake tokens, call hits, and climb leaderboards.",
      "The game’s AI learns from every move. If your Basilisk gets too strong — it becomes a target. If it dies? It’s burned forever. If it wins? You earn crypto, glory, and power."
